# niconverter

This library aloows converting raw multispot (96-ch) data files acquired with a custom NI-FPGA
board to Photon-HDF5 files. The processing is done in chunks so that
arbitrary large data files can be converted with constant RAM usage.

For more info see the niconverter module docstring.
